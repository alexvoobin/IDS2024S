1. The NAND operation is a combination of an AND followed by a NOT. It outputs true if any input is false. Symbolically, A NAND B is equivalent to ¬(A∧B). Similarly, the NOR operation is an OR followed by a NOT, outputting true only if both inputs are false. Symbolically, A NOR B is equivalent to ¬(A∨B). The NAND (NOT AND) and NOR (NOT OR) operations are logical gates used in digital circuits. A NAND gate outputs false only if all its inputs are true; otherwise, it outputs true. Mathematically, the NAND operation between two variables A and B can be expressed as ¬(A∧B), where ¬ denotes the NOT operation, and ∧ denotes the AND operation. Similarly, a NOR gate outputs true only if all its inputs are false. The NOR operation can be expressed as ¬(A∨B), where ∨ denotes the OR operation. It is crucial to ensure that logical expressions and equivalencies are stated correctly. In the realm of logical operations, precision is key, and as illustrated, even a small discrepancy can lead to significantly different outcomes.

4. **1**  Idempotence: AA=A: This identity asserts that if intersect a set with itself, get the same set. It implies that repeating an operation on a set doesn't change the set itself. This is crucial in simplifying Boolean expressions and reducing redundancy. A+A=A: Similarly, this identity states that the union of a set with itself remains the same set. It reinforces the concept that there is no duplication in set union. This property is essential in simplifying Boolean expressions and eliminating unnecessary terms. **2**  Commutativity: AB=BA: This property indicates that the order of elements in an intersection operation doesn't matter. It reflects the commutative nature of set intersection, where the result remains the same regardless of the order of operands.A+B=B+A: Similarly, this property states that the order of elements in a union operation doesn't affect the result. It highlights the commutative property of set union, where rearranging the operands doesn't alter the resulting set. **3**  Associativity: A(BC)=(AB)C=ABC: This identity demonstrates that the grouping of operations in intersections doesn't affect the final result. It reinforces the associative property of set intersection, where changing the grouping of sets in intersections doesn't change the overall result. A+(B+C)=(A+B)+C=A+B+C: Similarly, this identity shows that the grouping of operations in unions doesn't influence the final result. It highlights the associative property of set union, where rearranging the grouping of sets in unions doesn't change the resulting set. **4**  Distributivity: A(B+C)=AB+AC: This property demonstrates the distribution of intersection over union. It indicates that intersecting a set A with the union of sets B and C is equivalent to the union of intersections of A with B and A with C. This property is fundamental in simplifying Boolean expressions. A+BC=(A+B)(A+C): Similarly, this property illustrates the distribution of union over intersection. It shows that taking the union of a set A with the intersection of sets B and C is equivalent to the intersection of A with B unioned with the intersection of A with C. This property is essential in simplifying Boolean expressions and expressing them in canonical forms. **5** Duality: C=Aˉ+Bˉ: This duality property relates the complement of an intersection to the union of the complements of the constituent sets. It provides a convenient way to find the complement of an intersection operation. D=AˉBˉ: Similarly, this duality property connects the complement of a union to the intersection of the complements of the constituent sets. It offers a useful method for finding the complement of a union operation.

6. ABC’ has a longer base (BC’) compared ABC (BC), and both share the same height, then ABC’ will have a greater area (ABC’ ≥ ABC).  
7. Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers, Qualitative correspondence with common sense, and Consistency.
