1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 50 seconds and 51 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 50.5 seconds, 50.51 seconds, 50.50001 seconds, and so on. By contrast, number of persons in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 persons or 6, but not 5.5. For the example, position, size, color, and line width can represent continuous data, but shape and line type can usually only represent discrete data.  
2. Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot.
3. In addition to continuous and discrete numerical values, data can come in the form of discrete categories, in the form of dates or times. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical we call it qualitative.

5. **Ordered Data-** Quantitative Numerical **Unordered Data**- Quatitative Categorical
6. Month- Catergorical(Qualitative) Day- Discrete(Quantitative) Location- Categorical(Qualitative) Station ID- Categorical(Qualitative) Temperature- Continuous(Quantitative)
7. Cartesian coordinates
8. we can plot the temperature in Houston, TX against the temperature in San Diego, CA, for every day of the year (Figure a). Since the same quantity is plotted along both axes, we need to make sure that the grid lines form perfect squares, as is the case in Figure b.

10. data of a periodic nature
11. **Qualitative color scale:** a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product. **Color to represent data values:** Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. **Diverging color scale:** need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. **Color as a tool to highlight:** Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data. There may be specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key information about the story we want to tell, and we can strengthen the story by emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader.
12. It does not have Clear and concise representation of data, Appropriate use of visual elements (e.g. colors, shapes, sizes), Correct labeling of axes and data points, and Consistent scale and units.
13. The first color palettes would be more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans mainly because red is a warm and vibrant color.
