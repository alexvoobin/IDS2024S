1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. For example, time duration is a continuous value. Between any two durations, say 50 seconds and 51 seconds, there are arbitrarily many intermediates, such as 50.5 seconds, 50.51 seconds, 50.50001 seconds, and so on. By contrast, number of persons in a room is a discrete value. A room can hold 5 persons or 6, but not 5.5. For the example, position, size, color, and line width can represent continuous data, but shape and line type can usually only represent discrete data.
