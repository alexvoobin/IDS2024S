1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. Color, Size, Shape, Position, Line type, and Line width.  
2. Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot. discrete  
3. In addition to continuous and discrete numerical values, data can come in the form of discrete categories, in the form of dates or times. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical we call it qualitative.
4. Factors
5. **Ordered Data-** Quantitative Numerical ex- grades **Unordered Data**- Quatitative Categorical ex- others, greet letters, race, gender
6. Month- Catergorical(Qualitative) Day- Discrete(Quantitative) Location- Categorical(Qualitative) Station ID- Categorical(Qualitative) Temperature- Continuous(Quantitative) 
7. Cartesian coordinates
8. we can plot the temperature in Houston, TX against the temperature in San Diego, CA, for every day of the year (Figure a). Since the same quantity is plotted along both axes, we need to make sure that the grid lines form perfect squares, as is the case in Figure b.
9. all of them because they all have data points and the coordinates work.  
10. data of a periodic nature
11. **Qualitative color scale:** a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product. **Color to represent data values:** Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. **Diverging color scale:** need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. **Color as a tool to highlight:** Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data. There may be specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key information about the story we want to tell, and we can strengthen the story by emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader.
12. It starts before zero so its wrong.  
13. The first color palettes would be more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans mainly because red is a warm and vibrant color.

17. Classical Probability, Frequentist Probability, Bayesian Probability, and Axiomatic Probability.  
18. In the linear regression regression the residuals will be higher than the quadratic regression, because regression line gets away from the data values in the end, While in quadratic regression residulas are not too far from the regression line. Therefore quadratic regression is a better fit. Linear regression predict around 0.9 degree celcius temperature anamoly. While quadratic regression predicts it around 3 degees celcius.  
19. I see two living creatures, A frog and A type of fish underneath the frog opening its mouth.  
20. I would move the first stick where 8 is to make it into a 9 and then move the stick to the 0 to make it an 8. so the equation would now be 9+3-4=8 which is true.
