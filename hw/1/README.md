2. Local, Centralized, and Distributed.  
3. Distributed version control is the most sophisticated of the three. Here, each local repository fully mirrors the central repository, including its history. This means that even if the central repository becomes corrupted, it's not a problem.  
4. git pull - Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes.  
git status - Lists all new or modified files to be committed.  
git add --all - Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning.  
git commit -m"latest build" - Records file snapshots permanetly in version history.  
git push --all - Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub.
