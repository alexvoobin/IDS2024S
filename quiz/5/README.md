1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. Color, Size, Shape, Position, Line type, and Line width.
2. Those that can represent continuous data and those that cannot. Positional Aesthetics, Non-Positional Aesthetics
3. Variables holding qualitative data are factors, and the different categories are called levels.
4. In addition to continuous and discrete numerical values, data can come in the form of discrete categories, in the form of dates or times. When data is numerical we also call it quantitative and when it is categorical we call it qualitative.
5. Factors or categorical variables.  
6. Ordered Data- Quantitative Numerical ex- grades Unordered Data- Quatitative Categorical ex- others, greet letters, race, gender.
7.  are best suited for visualizing data that exhibit circular or periodic patternsdata. data of a periodic nature.
8. Qualitative color scale: a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different manufacturers of a certain product. Color to represent data values: Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. Diverging color scale: need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint. Color as a tool to highlight: Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data. There may be specific categories or values in the dataset that carry key information about the story we want to tell, and we can strengthen the story by emphasizing the relevant figure elements to the reader.
9. they are generally avoided due to the aforementioned challenges in interpretation, presentation, and accessibility.
10. Numerical Representation: Numerical Variables: Age, height, weight, test scores. Categorical Representation:  Categorical Variables: Gender, favorite subject, student type (e.g., regular, honors). Example Dataset (Categorical Representation)Example Dataset (Numerical Representation).  In the numerical representation, the dataset focuses on numerical attributes such as age, height, weight, and test scores, which are quantitative and can be measured or represented as numbers. In the categorical representation, the dataset emphasizes categorical attributes such as gender, favorite subject, and student type, which represent different categories or classes that the students belong to. Therefore, depending on how the dataset is represented, it can be classified as either numerical or categorical.
11. Color can be considered as both a categorical/unordered and a quantitative/ordered aesthetic, depending on how it is used in a visualization.
12. All three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data.
13. The first color palettes would be more appropriate for effective visualization communications with humans mainly because red is a warm and vibrant color.
14. Which city’s temperature is the least varying throughout the year? Chicago has the least varying temperature through the year here.   
Which city’s temperature is the wildest varying throughout the year? Death Valley   
Which city the hottest in the month of January? Sandiego   
Which city the coolest in the month of July? Sandiego   
15. A) qualitative color scale   
    B) Color to represent data values   
    C) diverging color scale   
    D) Color as a tool to highlight
16. The Color scales that has been used for this visual is the Color as a tool to highlight.
17. What is ugly in the chart is the Visualization of the chart and to fix it you can rearrange it to make it look more cleaner.  
18. **Excel Table** ![Excel table](Question18quiz5excel.xlsx)
19. Looking at the graph we can see a trend that the mid point of the fluctuation of temperature is increasing as we go towards the 2050. Hence quite naturally, the temperature will increase in the next few decades. Also the mean of the fluctuations is increasing almost lineaely past 2000. Using an eye approximation, the temperature of earth in 2050 will be approximately 2 degree celcius higher than the avg. temperature in between 1951 to 1980
