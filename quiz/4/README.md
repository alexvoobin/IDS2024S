6. If there is prior knowledge suggesting that horses are more common in the area or if there's some reason to believe that the likelihood of seeing a horse is higher than seeing a donkey, then I might lean towards trusting the person who observed a horse. On the other hand, if there are reasons to believe that donkeys are more common or if there's specific information suggesting a higher likelihood of seeing a donkey, then I might trust the person who observed a donkey. which observation I trust depends on the strength of the prior beliefs and the reliability of the observers, and Bayesian inference allows for a principled way to update those beliefs based on new evidence.
