1. The fastest component is Registers  
2. Modern computer memory is comprised of hierarchical structure with varying sizes and speeds along with the CPU predicting and prefetch the future data or instructions from the slower but larger levels of memory hierarchy to the higher levels for subsequent usage by the CPU for computations.  
3. The slowest storage device is Disk  
4. Disk, DRAM, L3 cache, L2 cache, L1 cache, Registers
5. The smallest unit of information is a bit
6. 0 and 1 were chosen because it is simplfied and use electric voltage and electricity flow or the lack of flow to store and process data as a sequence.
